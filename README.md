# üéØ Java Number Guessing Game

This is a simple Java console game where the computer thinks of a random number between 0 and 100, and you try to guess it!



## üïπÔ∏è How the Game Works

1. The program generates a random number between 0 and 100.
2. You make a first guess.
3. If it‚Äôs correct ‚Äî great! If not:
   - It tells you if your guess is Too High or Too Low
   - You keep guessing until you get it right
4. At the end, it tells you how many tries it took and gives a fun message based on your performance.
